Description: Implementation of the efficient difference-in-differences estimator 
    as described in "Efficient Difference-in-Differences and Event Study 
    Estimators" by Chen, Sant'Anna, and Xie (2025). The implementation does not 
    allow for covariates and restricts the number of pre-periods used for 
    estimation to be equal across treatment groups. Event study and calendar 
    time aggregation are included.
